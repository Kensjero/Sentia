Familiar technologies:
- Powershell

Newly learned technologies:
- JSON files
- Template and parameter files
- Azure policies
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage

Assumptions:
- The deployment component (.ps1) contains comment-blocks describing all the actions done.
- It wasn't specified wether the used credentials must be stored safe, we did this anyway (curiousity).
- Since I couldn't test anything, I verified my JSON fiels through https://jsonlint.com/, and assumed it would be OK.

(Storage):
- resilience put to LRS. In a test environment we don't need constant-availability.
- We put encryption on both the blobs and the files.

(Vnet):
- We didn't know for what the subnets were used, so we just generically named them, and gave them generic IP ranges. 

(NIC):
- We didn't configure a PIP, neither made any changes varying from default in this area since there are no further actions required with the NIC. 

(VM)
- We assumed the range of accepted OS to be 2012 R2 +. but made the OS 2016 DC instead. This is of course the latest stable build.
- We hardcoded the image published to be strictly from MS (MicrosoftWindowsServer). This due to security purposes.
- We assumed the size to be Standard_D2_v2 since there wasn't any need for optimization in any aspect (e.g. computing, graphic load).
