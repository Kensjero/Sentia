To be honest, I'm not sure how accurate this time entry is. Please keep in mind, that I had to double-check twice since I couldn't test my work.

Sat: 
13:00 - 18:00: Pluralsight, skipping ahead to the usefull sections, awesome!
18:00 - 23:00(yeah, really..): Figuring out JSON files and structure etc..
23:00 - 02:00: Created my own JSON template in Visual Studio (not pirated, I swear!)
02:00 - 04:00: Reading documentation from MS. Fell asleep.

Obviously had brakes inbetween, but its just an estimate.

Sun:
13:00 - 15:00: Further Pluralsighting
15:00 - 19:00(yeah, really...): Figuring out how in the hell these template files and parameter files work... Also policies..
19:00 - 23:00: Figured it out (sorta) and created a first VM. (in my head since I couldn't actually reate one) 
23:00- 24:00: Embraced my imaginary VM, and made some more!

Mon:
12:00 - 13:00: Mentally preparing
13:00 - 17:00: Building policy, deployment script, JSON template and parameter files, triple checking everything, writing up documentation, uploading last pieces to GitHub. 


Actual time spent should be around 20 hours. 
Next deployment ETA (not actually arriving anywere but whatever, sound cool.): 5 - 10 hours (didn't master it yet)
