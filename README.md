# Sentia; Start-End: (Saturday - Monday); Total hours spent estimated: 20-25

My prior experience with Azure was solely with Intune (MDM). 

First off' i'd like to thank you for the given oppertunity to learn new stuff! This was ALL new to me, and I had a really great time playing around in the sandbox. I even learned to use Visual Studio, and create a JSON file with it (what?!). Also I didn't have a credit card therefore I couldn't create a test account, so everything is theoretical! I unfortunately don't have the chance to test any of this...


Right from the bat I can tell you that the hardest part of the whole assignment was to understand the JSON file structure. I've never seen a JSON file before the assignment, nor did I perform any Java programming, and there were many options to reach the functional endgoal. I personally chose to create the JSON file(s) myself in Visual Studio 2017, to get a better understanding of the language and structure (mission succeeded). Bad side, however, is that this took me nearly a day including training videos and documentation to properly understand it. If i knew this, I wouldn't have postponed the assignment till the weekend ;).

Also the linkage between the JSON file and the JSON parameter file was a little bit tricky to grasp (for me).

To be perfectly honest I'm not even sure if it works as it is, due to the inability to test the solution i've built.
